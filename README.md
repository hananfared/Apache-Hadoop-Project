## Data Description:

We have dataset that contains information about Chicago employee data.
The file name: employee-data.csv
It consists of 32928 record involved (Name, Job Titles, Department, Full or Part-Time, Typical Hours, Annual Salary,
Hourly Rate) as columns names.

## Requirements:

1) Create a Hive table named employee-data-hive based on the given dataset.

2) Create a department-data-hive table by selecting unique department names from the
employee-data-hive,
and adding a column named deptID in the new department-data-hive table,
and put unique values in the deptID column.
Alternatively, you can pre-process the employee-data
and select the unique department names, add DeptID column and assign unique value in the new Colum using excel or mySQL database separately,
and then consider this structure (depart-name, DeptID) to create the departmentdata-hive table.

3) Update the employee-data-hive table by replacing the department field data with the
deptID values as created in the department-data-hive table.
Also update the employee-data-hive table 'annual salary' field based on the 'Typical
Hours' * 'Hourly Rate' * 52 if the annual salary field is empty.

4) Display all employees list with salary more than $100,000 based on employee-datahive table.
Also join the ‘employee-data-hive’ and ‘department-data-hive’ table to show the
average salary of employees by department name.

5) Create 5 partitions in an ‘employees_ptn’ table to store 5 departments in the
appropriate partition.
Display the partition structure.

6) Create spark DataFrame based on the given dataset.
 Identify # of records in the DataFrame
 and show top 10 records.
